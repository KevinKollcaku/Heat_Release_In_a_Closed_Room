# Heat_Relese_In_a_Closed_Romm

This code is part of a paper work done for a school project. The paper talkes about analysing the way we can model the heat release of a heat source to the rest of the room. We are analysing the system in a steady state, and assuming that no external heat source is involvet. That is why we can think of this as taking anly a short time frame and assuming how the energy would spread to the rest of the room, given that the source of the heat is no longer available.
Here we have included the C++ code that will simulate this idea.
We have used Numerical methods to perfirm the calcualtion, such as Gauss-Siedel method and also some mathmetical transforamtion to discretify the problme of the heat release.
